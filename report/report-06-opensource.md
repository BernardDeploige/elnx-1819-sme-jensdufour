All tools we use in the course are open source. Some, like Ansible, were developed by a software company that built a business model around them. Others were developed by enthusiasts in their spare time. In any case, we can use high quality software for free, thanks to the efforts of many. 

It is appropriate to give something in return, so the intention is to make a significant contribution to the development of the software. deliver to an open source project related to the course. This can be a small contribution but only if it has been accepted by the author(s) of the project.

## Documentation
 
During my project I made some additions to open source projects. This started very small to learn how to operate using Pull Requests on Github. 
After this introduction those will all be discussed. 

### [firstcontributions/first-contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/pull/13153)

My (merged) commit to this repository was rather simple, it is designed to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time. 
The guide is written in multiple languages and makes sure that the process of PR on Github is familiar afterwards.

### [MicrosoftDocs/windowsserverdocs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windowsserverdocs/pull/2140)

During the first draft of my Bachelor's thesis I found certain mistakes in the documentation of the latest version of Windows Server 2019. I submitted the correction via a PR and this was later merged to the documentation.

My final PR is still under review after someone on the development team requested changes. I am working to make sure this PR also gets merged in the near future.
